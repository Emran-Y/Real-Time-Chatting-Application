## Vortext Verse - Personal Chat App Project

Vortext Verse is a personal project crafted using a React JS client, Node JS and Express JS server, and a MongoDB database, serves as a showcase in my portfolio.

### Features:

- JWT-based authentication for enhanced security
- Real-time communication using Socket.io
- Secure storage of user details in encrypted format in MongoDB
- Create both one-to-one and group chats for versatile communication

  

### Project Status:

- **Client:** Developed using React JS
- **Server:** Powered by Node JS and Express JS
- **Database:** Utilizes MongoDB

### Current Focus:

I'm currently refining the Socket.io functionalities to enhance the real-time communication experience and another features.

Feel free to explore the code and project structure. This project is a reflection of my passion for coding and showcasing my skills as a junior developer. I welcome any feedback or suggestions as I continue to develop and improve Vortext Verse.
